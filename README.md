# Drawscape
iOS app I created using Swift and ARKit.
This app allows users to virtually paint onto nearby walls using a variety of color palettes and brush types.

# How To Run:
Open the entire project folder in XCode and hit the run button in the upper left hand corner to install the application to your iPhone/iPad.  
Load the app on your phone/tablet, and position the device parallel to the wall, preferably 5 feet away.
Then, the app will recognize the wall.  
Once you're happy with the size of the generated canvas, click on the check button to lock it into place.
Then, paint away with the various brushes and colors.

# Motivation:
I was really intrigued watching Apple's annual devloper conference.  They spoke about their improvements they made to their ARKit, which motivated me to just right into the application process and create an app.  I didn't have any Swift or iOS experience but I thought the best way to learn would be to start building something from scratch.  I ended up learning a lot and in the end I created an awesome app that I can impress my friends with :)
