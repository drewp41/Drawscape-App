# Drawscape-App
iOS app I created using Swift and ARKit.
This app allows you to paint onto walls using a variety of brushes and colors.

Load the app, and position the phone parallel to the wall, preferably 5 feet away.
Then, the app will recognize the wall.  
Once you're happy with the size of the generated canvas, click on the check button to lock it into place.
Then, paint away with the various brushes and colors!!
